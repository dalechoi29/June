    title = "wikipedia_sleep">Sleep</a> is a naturally recurring state of mind and body, characterized by altered consciousness, <br>
    relatively inhibited sensory activity, reduced muscle activity and inhibition of nearly all voluntary <br>
    muscles during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep,[1] and reduced interactions with surroundings.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:15px">
    It is distinguished from wakefulness by a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but more reactive <br>
    than coma or disorders of consciousness, sleep displaying very different and active brain patterns.
